# Assignment 3 

React native project Assignment 3

## Task Description 

In this assignment, I reacreated a design using all the components stated in the question. 

## Component Description
A brief description of each component's usage

### 1. View
I used `View` as a container for other components to be stored in. Like a `div` tag in HTML

### 2. Text
I used the `Text` component to display text in my app.

### 3. ScrollView
I used the `ScrollView` component to make all the contents after the View component styled `frame1` scrollable. 

### 4. TextInput
I used the `TextInput` component to allow users to input text in the searchbox.

### 5. StyleSheet
I used the `StyleSheet` to style my components.

### 6. Button
The `Button` is to create touchable buttons. But I used the `TouchableOpacity` component to create touchable buttons. 

### 7. FlatList
I used the `FlatList` to render list of data in my `CategoriesCard.js` and `OngoingTask.js` located in the `components` folder. <br> It is usually preferred for rendering long list because of its efficiency.

### 8. Image
I used the `Image` component to display images and icons in the app.
